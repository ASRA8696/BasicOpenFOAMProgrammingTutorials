running "Allwclean" will clean the setup
and running "Allwmake" will run the case.

This is a simple 2D wave simulation with initial condition where a single peak
amplitude region was placed at center of 2d plane.

the simulation computes on how the waves propagate and recreate new waves
through reflection, their constructive and destructive interference also
can be clearly seen

geometry/mesh is a 1X1X0.01 box with single cell thick, and with "empty" bc on
top and bottom faces

the video file "output.mp4" is the simulation output generated as an
animation.
